In December 2020, I started working on [Mono](/projects/mono) (as of writing, it hasn't been announced what it is yet; so check the project page for it to learn more). I wanted to start a simple initiative to allow an easy distinction that all of the sub-projects are private-by-default. I also wanted to make it easy for others to say: "I want to be a part of this" in turn. So, I've started working on "La campagne «vie privée par défaut»" or "The 'Privacy by Default' campaign."

(more info will appear here and in the timeline as progress is made)
