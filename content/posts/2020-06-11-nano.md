Nano v0.3.0 is here and now, among many other things, has support for blogging!
<!--more-->

Since day one, Nano was a project to make a clean, fast, and mobile-friendly Jekyll theme that people could easily use and deploy themselves. When I first released the gem on RubyGems, I was amazed to see the downloads skyrocket to 100 in the first day. Now, as of writing, Nano is at a little over 1500 downloads on RG, and I realised I still need to deliver on two crucial things:

- Amazing Mobile Support, and:
- Official Blogging Support.

Well, with the release of Nano v0.3.0, I'm happy to announce blogging being here on Nano. You might wonder: why'd it take you so long? There are plenty reasons I could say, but I'll keep it narrowed to the cold hard truth: I just didn't realise the importance of Jekyll for blogging until recently. When I was personally setting up the newsroom section on my website, I realised it was such a clunky and crappy solution.

Fortunately, I made the theme I used (which is this theme), and decided I'd finally get to work on adding blogging support. I did my utmost best to document it to the best of my ability and make it as painless as possible to deploy into sites using this theme.
