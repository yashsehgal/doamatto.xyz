And Nano is all out of bubblegum.
<!--more-->

Y'know, the people who use Nano have yet to seize to amaze me. As of writing, the [nano-theme RubyGem](https://rubygems.org/gems/nano-theme) is at over 2,500 downloads. It's awesome to see how so many people are using Nano. Thanks for helping support Nano and (although I'd prefer it in GitHub as issues) for emailing me all your feature requests and bugs.

Now, enough of the thanks: we all know you're here to see what's the latest and greatest in Nano v0.4.0. And, as every other v0.X.0 update, it's a doozy.

To start, blogging got a large overhaul. You can now use categories to sort your posts (I plan to add by Month-Year in the future). You can enable this feature in the config file. Amongst that addition were some nice quality of life changes:
- Improved readibility of link to Atom feed
- Added author meta tags for posts and site-wide, if either are set
- Added a 'Subscribe to Atom feed' buttom to posts[^1]

[^1]: When categories are disabled in the config, this link stays. The tags are normally with it when categories are enabled 

Apart from those changes, support for tables are officially here.

| Column A | Column B |
| -------- | -------- |
| Row 1    | Row 1    |
| Row 2    | Row 2    |
| Row 3    | Row 3    |

They took me awhile to do as they were a little hard to design to make it look nice on both light and dark theme while keeping a similar colour pallete.

Apart from tables, support for task lists was added, as well as better support footnotes, definition lists, and images.

Some smaller peace of minds that were added:
- **A LOT** of CSS/SASS minimizations
- Inline code blocks are now styled similarly to nested code blocks[^2]
- Links outside of lists will have underlines
- Hovering over a link in the navigation won't cause it to look like it disappeared (a very minor issue, obviously)
- The horizontal rule on the footer is now smaller and properly centres itself
- The classic look is back to Nano. On:
  - **Desktop:** You get the classic look
  - **Laptop/Tablet:** You get the new look with the bigger margins (size cap to become this size is 992px in width)
  - **Mobile:** Same good ol' margins
- Updated media queries to improve mobile compatibility[^3]
- Fixed typo in gemspec that could cause issues

Apart from that, that was some of the new things in Nano v0.4.0. You can install it today via [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/nano-theme) or read the full changelog via [GitHub](https://github.com/doamatto/nano/releases/v0.4.0).

[^2]: Nested code blocks have a padding of `.5vh` on the top and bottom and `1vh` on the left and right. Inline codeblocks go from `.5vh` to `.25vh` and `1vh` goes to `.5vh`.
[^3]: Previously, I used `max-device-width` in media queries to set mobile views and desktop views apart. However, [this is discouraged](https://web.dev/responsive-web-design-basics/) and, for that reason, I switched it to the `max-width` instead.
